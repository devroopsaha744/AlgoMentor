# NovaAI
This is a multi-AI agent system that is developed to automate the problem-setting task. On the basis of a given topic and difficulty, this system researches  the relevant questions, tips, and approaches for that particular topic and difficulty and jots them down in a document. People can use it to find the relevant coding problems that they need to practice in a systematic and automatic manner, thus it saves time. 

I am using Mixtral 8x7B LLM for this project

Working to make it more complex and multidimensional
